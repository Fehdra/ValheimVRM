-----------------------------------------------------------


### How to install 
Download extract it. There will be a folder called release, copy the folders inside (BepInEx,valheim_Data) into your valheim install directory.
The folders are setup to put the files where they need to go.

Create a folder named ValheimVRM in the main game directory alongside valheim.exe and place your VRM character inside it.

### Settings
The name of the character in the game needs to correspond to a VRM and settings file like so.

**Character**: Midnight Nova \
**Settings File**: Midnight Nova_settings.txt \
**VRM**: Midnight Nova.vrm


### Default Settings and avatar for people you do not have custom stuff for.

You can have Default settings now, to use this. create a settings___Default.txt file, and pair
___Default.vrm with it. \
**NOTE:** settings___Default.txt has 4 underscores, and ___Default.vrm has 3.
